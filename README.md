# JScan
JavaScript Scanner


### Ultimate Goal
This project is meant to be a learning opportunity about extracting JavaScript from different loading methods. 
It should eventually grab any <script> tags and write them to a file
As well it should load all external JavaScript files found looking for <script http(s)://
Using the Python module Dryscrape it will fully load the JavaScript allowing the engineer the ability to perform static code analysis on the different files.  
                                                                               

### Future Plans
Ensure all JavaScript is collected
Add JsHint support for static code analysis on the fly.  
Reporting?  Logging?
Paths to add to Burpsuite if looking at a DOM driven JS web application
